## Unit Assignment: Student Store

Submitted by: **Anita Dugbartey**


### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES


- [x] **Database Creation**: Set up a Postgres database to store information about products and orders.
  - [x] Use the provided schema to create tables for `products`, `orders`, and `order_items`.
- [x] **Products Model**: Develop a model to represent individual items available in the store. 
  - [x] This model should include attributes such as `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `image_url`, and `category`.
  - [x] Implement methods for CRUD operations on products.
  - [x] Ensure transaction handling for the deletion of products to also delete related `order_items`
- [x]**Orders Model**: Develop a model to manage orders. 
  - [x] This model should include attributes such as `order_id`, `customer_id`, `total_price`, `status`, and `created_at`.
  - [x] Implement methods for creating, fetching, updating, and deleting orders.
  - [x] Ensure transaction handling for the deletion of orders to also delete related `order_items`
- [x] **Order Items Model**: Develop a model to represent the items within an order. 
  - [x] This model should include attributes such as `order_item_id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, and `price`.
  - [x] Implement methods for fetching and creating order items.
- [x] **API Endpoints**
  - [x] **Product Endpoints**:
    - [x] `GET /products`: Fetch a list of all products.
    - [x] `GET /products/:id`: Fetch details of a specific product by its ID.
    - [x] `POST /products`: Add a new product to the database.
    - [x] `PUT /products/:id`: Update the details of an existing product.
    - [x] `DELETE /products/:id`: Remove a product from the database.
  - [x] **Order Endpoints**:
    - [x] `GET /orders`: Fetch a list of all orders.
    - [x] `GET /orders/:order_id`: Fetch details of a specific order by its ID, including the order items.
    - [x] `POST /orders`: Create a new order with order items.
    - [x] `PUT /orders/:order_id`: Update the details of an existing order (e.g., change status).
    - [x] `DELETE /orders/:order_id`: Remove an order from the database.
- [x] **Frontend Integration**
  - [x] Connect the backend API to the provided frontend interface, ensuring dynamic interaction for product browsing, cart management, and order placement. Adjust the frontend as necessary to work with your API.


#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] **Added Endpoints**
  - [ ] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database.
  - [ ] Create an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its ID.
- [ ] **Filter Orders**
  - [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.
- [ ] **Implement Your Own Frontend**
  - [ ] Build your own user interface for browsing products, managing the shopping cart, and placing orders. This will involve integrating the frontend you create with the backend API you developed during the project.
- [ ] **Past Orders Page**

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I feel like the labs were very helpful especially when it came to building the models in Schema. I didn't really feel prepared to complete my API endpoints because postman kept giving me a hard time in terms of error intepretation and debugging.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

  I would have implemented stretch features which I feel would have shown proper mastery of the unit. This unit was really difficult so I'm proud I was able to complete the required features.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think my presentation went well as I was able to complete 95% of the requirements by the time the demo came along. My order items wasn't properly connected to my Prisma so I had trouble passing items to the database. Next time I woudl like to try to customize the frontend which some of my peers did beautifully.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
There are so many people I want to thank and I can't choose one: Maria (Helped me connect back and frontend),
Keith, Erica, Sammy (Former FTL), Alyssa (engineer on my mentor‚Äôs team), Carlos (my mentor), and Devarsh for fixing errors with my endpoints and guiding me through this project. I struggled but these individuals remained patient with me and for that I am grateful.
